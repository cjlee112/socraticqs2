How to name a thread
-----------------------------------------

Choose a name that's **short** (a few words) and **distinct** (helps students easily recognize this specific question in your courselet's list of questions, shown in the sidebar).  For example, if your courselet presented questions about probability, and this question was the only one that featured trains (as an example), you could name it something like "Two Trains".  Don't try to make the name a summary of what the question's asking -- that will be too long.

How to write a good question
-----------------------------------------------------

Brief advice:

* take a real-world situation that's representative of how you think students should be able to apply a concept you've taught, but which is different from examples you have already shown them how to solve.

* focus your question small enough that students only need to think about that *one* concept.

* "hide in plain sight" (difficulty level): correct application of the concept should lead pretty directly to the right answer (without requiring difficult usage of other skills such as solving equations), but it should not be guessable.  In general, about 1/3 to 2/3 of your students should be able to do it.

* Your question should ask for a definite, specific answer (so that it's easy for students to self-assess whether their answer is right, by comparison with your answer).  

* Your question should also ask students to briefly explain their reasoning for how they arrived at their answer, so that you'll be able to diagnose the underlying conceptual errors directly from students' responses.

* keep your question SHORT, like a real chat conversation on Slack.  If it seems too long, use various ways to split it into smaller pieces: **background explanations** should be moved to a separate Introduction thread; state your question briefly, and if you're concerned some students may need additional clarifications, provide them in an embedded audio or video clip.
