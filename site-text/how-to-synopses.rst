How to name a thread
-----------------------------------------

**Choose a name that's short** -- a few words -- and **distinct** -- that helps students easily recognize this question within the list shown in the sidebar.  For example, if your courselet presented questions about probability, and this question was the only one that featured trains (as an example), you could name it something like "Two Trains".  Don't try to make the name a summary of what the question's asking -- that will be too long.

How to write a good question
-----------------------------------------------------

Brief advice:

* **take a real-world situation** that's representative of how you think students should be able to apply a concept you've taught, but different from examples you've already shown them how to solve.

* **focus your question** small enough that students only need to think about that **one concept**.

* **difficulty**: thinking about that concept should lead pretty directly to the answer, without requiring other skills such as solving equations, but it should not be guessable.  In general, about 1/3 to 2/3 of your students should be able to do it.

* **ask for a definite, specific answer**, so that it's easy for students to self-assess whether their answer is right, by comparison with *your* answer.  

* **also ask students to briefly explain their reasoning** for how they arrived at their answer, so that you'll be able to discover underlying misconceptions directly from students' responses.

* **keep your question SHORT, like a real chat** conversation.  If it seems too long, use various ways to split it into smaller pieces: **background explanations** should be moved to a separate Introduction thread; **state your question briefly**, even if you're concerned some students may need **additional clarifications**: provide those separately in an embedded audio or video clip. 

How to write a good answer
------------------------------------------------

* **first provide a clear, brief statement** of the definite, specific answer, so students can easily see whether their own answer was right.

* **then give a brief explanation** of the logic showing how the concept leads to this conclusion, so that students get a second chance to see whether their thinking was correct.

* **don't warn about potential wrong ways** of thinking; save that for the Error Models (see below).

* **keep your answer brief** by only including the core points sufficient for most students.

* **for students who need additional explanations**, provide those separately in an embedded audio or video clip.


How to write a good Error Model
-------------------------------------------------

* **write a one-sentence statement** of this point-of-view in the form "I thought...", as its title, e.g. "I thought all that glitters is gold."

* **explain the misconception**: outline the thought process that produces this point of view, and point out exactly where exactly it goes wrong vs. the correct understanding.

* **identify precisely what the student must change**, to use this concept correctly.

* **for students who need additional explanations** (e.g. a counter-example where this belief leads to an obviously absurd conclusion), provide those separately in an embedded audio or video clip.
