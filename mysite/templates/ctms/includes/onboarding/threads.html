  Your courselet is made up of multiple brief discussions with your students, called threads.
  A thread usually contains a question that challenges the student with a real-world problem.
  They will practice critical thinking, self-assess, and get a personalized path based on their
  knowledge and their answers. We never grade students on Courselets â€“ we just want to uncover conceptual
  errors (we call them blindspots) and fix them.
