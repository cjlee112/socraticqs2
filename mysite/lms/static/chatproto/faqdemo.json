    "answer": "1/6 is the likelihood of any roll outcome under the F state. 1/2 is the likelihood of rolling a six under the L state.  1/10 is the likelihood of any other outcome (i.e. anything but a six) under the L state.  Note that the question explicitly asked you to calculate the joint probability of both the observed rolls and the hidden states (not JUST the hidden states)."
